# schema-generator
The program can be used to parse a specific markdown structure and output either a schema.db file that can be visualized with dbdiagram.io or a schema.gql file that can used as a stub for graphql queries. 

## install & run
```bash
npm install
```
### dbdiagrams
```bash
npm run parse:dbd http://github.com/raw/link_to.md
```

### graphql
```bash
npm run parse:graphql http://github.com/raw/link_to.md
```

Output can be found in the root directory.

## Apollo server
If a graphql schema was created you can interact with it by spinning up an Apollo server with the provided docker file.
```bash
docker build . -t gql-test/apollo-server
docker run -p 4000:4000 gql-test/apollo-server
```
You can now go to <a href="http://localhost:4000/graphql">http://localhost:4000/graphql</a> to inspect the generated schema

Tested with node v10.15.3
